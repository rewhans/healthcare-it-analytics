# Healthcare IT Service Desk Analytics

This repository contains my independent project for the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program.  
The project analyzes anonymized IT service desk ticket data from a healthcare system to uncover operational trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement.  

## 📊 Project Overview
As part of my role in healthcare IT support, I see firsthand how system outages, ticket volume, and support processes impact hospital operations.  
This project applies data analytics to real-world IT data to answer key questions:
- What are the most common types of support tickets?
- Which departments submit the highest volume of requests?
- How do resolution times vary by category and priority?
- What patterns emerge over time (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- Where can resources or automation reduce bottlenecks?

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
Documentation → Project brief, methodology, notes, README

Raw Data → Original (anonymized) service desk export

Clean Data → Processed datasets used for analysis

Scripts_Code → Python notebooks and scripts for cleaning, analysis, visualization

Visualizations → Charts, dashboards, figures

Sent_to_Client → Final deliverables (report, presentation deck)


## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Streamlit (for dashboarding)
- Excel (initial data exploration)

## 🚀 Key Features
- Ticket volume and resolution time analysis
- Categorization of requests by department and issue type
- Trend analysis over time (seasonality, peaks)
- Interactive dashboard for exploring results
- Actionable recommendations for IT leadership

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Apply end-to-end data analysis to a real-world healthcare IT context
- Demonstrate ability to clean, organize, and analyze operational data
- Communicate insights through professional reports and dashboards

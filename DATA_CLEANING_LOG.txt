DATA_CLEANING_LOG
  Each entry just answers one of these questions:
  What boundary did I enforce?
  What assumption did I lock in?
  What decision did I make that future-me might forget?
  What could break if new data arrives?

Entry 1
  Date: 
    1/07/2026
  Dataset: 
    CLEANED--HRSA_MUA--State Level_Export_Statewide_2024
  Issue discovered: 
    `service_area_name` uses inconsistent casing (mixed title case and all caps).
  Why it matters: 
    Inconsistent text formatting can cause grouping issues and visual noise in downstream summaries; also signals inconsistent upstream standards.
  What I did: 
    Standardized casing using a helper column to enforce uniform formatting.
  Still unclear: 
    Whether casing inconsistencies appear in other HRSA exports and should be handled programmatically rather than manually.

Entry 2
  Date: 
    1/09/2026
  Dataset: 
    CLEANED--HRSA_MUA--County Level_Export_IredellPeers_2024
  What boundary did I enforce?
    State-level and county-level HRSA datasets are treated as analytically separate despite sharing identical schemas
  What assumption did I lock in?
    Geographic granularity (state vs county) determines valid comparisons, regardless of structural similarity.
  What decision did I make that future-me might forget?
    I intentionally prohibited cross-level joins or comparisons to avoid semantic misuse of shared fields.
  What could break if new data arrives?
    If future datasets blur geographic levels or introduce mixed-granularity records, joins and aggregations could silently misrepresent service coverage or designation status.

Entry 3
  Date: 
    1/12/2026
  Dataset: 
    CDC PLACES – City/Town Level (2023–2024)
  Decision surfaced: 
    Filtered records to North Carolina using exact matches on `StateAbbr == "NC"` or `StateDesc == "north carolina"`.
  Why it mattered: 
    This filter determines the geographic scope of all downstream analysis and assumes state identifiers are clean and consistent.
  What alternative I did not choose: 
    Using FIPS codes or a reference table to enforce state membership more defensibly.
  Open question / risk: 
    If future data includes variations (e.g., trailing spaces, abbreviations beyond "NC", or mixed encodings), relevant records could be silently excluded.
